JDK (Java Development Kit): A complete toolkit for developing Java applications, including JRE, compiler, debugger, and tools.
JRE (Java Runtime Environment): A runtime environment for executing Java applications, containing the JVM and standard libraries, but no development tools.
 
 
 #4 How Java Works 

Java code is platfrom independent since it runs on JVM 


but jvm is platform independent but JVM takes code in Byte

We create a java code 

compiler convert it into byte code for jvm 

And Byte code runs on the jvm



A project can be big having a hundreds of file , but jvm needs one file to execute

the execution starts with Main and it must have specific signature

main looks for signature 
 public static void main(String[] args)

 we write code the compiler compiles and the java code becomes BYTE FILE 

 Jvm takes this byte code and run it 

 the jvm looks for the main method first 

 we can compile the code using javac Hello.java

 IT WILL return the byte code file 


 jre has the libraries and jvm is responsible to run them 


 we install jdk 

 jdk has jre 

 jre has jvm

 to run only jre and jvm is requried 


We solve real world problem in virtual world 


data is neeeded to be stored 

2 types of data 

permanent and variable 

variable needed to be stored temp



printlnn is print  in new line 


Literals are the values assigned to Variables 

Take the data types x


 #7 Literal in Java 


we can put hexadecimal and binary numbers in int 

we can use _ for counting 100_000


#8 Type Conversion in Java

you can assign value of byte to integer but for integer to byte we have to cast by 

b = (byte)a 


conversion is automatically conversion and casting is explicit conversion 


Type Promotion in Java refers to the process where a smaller data type is automatically converted (promoted) to a larger data type when performing operations to prevent data loss.


*check type promotion

#14 Ternary Operator in Java 
A shorthand for if-else statements.
result = (condition) ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;

Ternary Operator (? :)




 #16 Need For Loop in Java 

We need to repeat the something again and again 

WHILE 
DO WHILE 
FOR LOOP
